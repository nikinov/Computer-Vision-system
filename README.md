# TorchAISystem

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a an image classifier that uses pytorch in Python and torchscript in C++ to train and make a prediction on a inseption model.

## Tutorial

This is an example tutorial on setup, make and deploy a Pytorch model.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- make sure you have a [compatible GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), feel free to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), when going through the install process make sure to select add conda to path!!!
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) make sure to select the following options, though if you use conda select the conda option instead of pip: <img width="613" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-14 at 1 36 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54107324/118200266-07bd5300-b455-11eb-81eb-3ddc7af0bddc.png">
- uninstall all NVIDIA drivers and files and then get [Cuda toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/accelerated-computing-toolkit) and [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), make sure it's the same as the one mentioned in pytorch, you can also follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raBkhUoeOHs) for pytorch and cuda installation
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with C++
- [LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/), for this process you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eTVqYGIWx0)

### How to Make

you can follow [this tutorial](https://learnopencv.com/image-classification-using-transfer-learning-in-pytorch/) for the python script
as well as [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk88zv1KYMI) for deploymant in C++

## integration
